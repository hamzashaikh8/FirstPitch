# FirstPitch

## About the Project

With the rise of remote work, more startups are being created, but the opportunity to present these to angel investors is become more difficult. In addition, many have great ideas but do not have access to a pool of connections and resources.

As such, the concept of our project FirstPitch is to allow users (entrepreneurs) around the world to present their startup ideas to angel investors from which they can invest in return for equity of that company.

Our solution will consist of a discussion board for angel investors to ask questions, propose an offer and display current valuation cap and bid.
